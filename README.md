[Ergosphere.club](https://ergosphere.club) is a site that lets you view and filter all kinds of ergonomic keyboards.
The keyboards and their configurations are all defined in a single YAML file.

To add a new keyboard or change an existing keyboard's configuration, you can modify the [keyboards.yaml](app/static/keyboards.yaml) file.
Further settings are also configurable in the [datamodel.yaml](app/static/datamodel.yaml) file.

If there's an ergonomic keyboard you've designed, use, or simply think is cool, consider adding it here!
